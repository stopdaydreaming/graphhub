# GraphHub

GraphHub is without question the best way to interact with GitHub. We've hired 1200 code monkeys to build the amazing piece of software. We truly believe it will change the world.

## GitHub Personal Access Token

We're interacting with GitHub today, so you'll need a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). You only need the `repo` related permissions.

## Cloning Down

* To run this project, set up the GitHub token mentioned above and then clone the project.

* Install dependencies with `$ yarn install`

* Run `$ cp ./src/config/secrets.example.js ./src/config/secrets.js`

* Run `$ yarn start`

## GraphiQL

GraphiQL is one of the most popular development tools for GraphQL. It's similar to Postman, but focused on GraphQL. Let's download the [desktop version](https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app) to get started.

Note: If you're having trouble doing that, you can use the [GraphQL Explorer](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/) on GitHub's site.

## Web IDE Alternative

If you're having trouble setting the app up locally, you can use [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#github.com/ni3t/graphhub) to run a VSCode WebIDE.
